<h1> Hello! My name is Xavier &#10024;<h1>
<h2>pronouns: he/him  age:22  major: graphic information technology (ux) </h2>

<p> I hope to go into a UX job after I graduate, which is something I was influenced to do by my uncle!<br>
    in middle school I visited his office in Dallas, where he worked at AT&T, and i knew what I wanted to do ever since<br>
    I was originally a Painting major at the University of Houston, as they didn't have a UX program there, but luckily have transferred here to pursue my proper career.<br>
    I was not originally interested in coding but have grown very fond of it and am incredibly excited to apply it to my knowledge of the graphic design aspect of UX. 
</p>
<p> Outside of school, I work as a barista and live in Houston, Texas with my boyfriend of 3 years. <br>
Some of my hobbies include...</p>
<ul>
    <li>Painting</li>
    <li>Playing Video Games (my favorite being any Zelda game) </p>
    <li>Playing with the cats at outside of my apartment complex</p>
</ul>
